## ðŸ–¥ How to Run the JavaScript Files

To run any JavaScript file in this repository, you need to have **Node.js** installed. If you haven't already, download and install it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

Once **Node.js** is set up, open your terminal and use the following command to run a JavaScript file:

```bash
node filename.js
